Here are a list of useful links and reading material which you can use for reference. A lot of them develop the basic skills you have learnt here, into much more advanced levels. 

- [LaTeX Wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
- [LaTeX Community](http://www.latex-community.org/)
- [Writing LaTeX by Andy Roberts](http://andy-roberts.net/writing/latex)
- [Gallery of TikZ examples](http://www.texample.net/)

Most of the problems or errors you will potentially meet will have been explained in one of the above links. Else, [Google](http://google.com) is always the best way to find an answer.

If you need to look up the code for a symbol, try these:

- [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/) is an online LaTeX symbol recogniser. Also available as an [iOS app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/detexify/id328805329?mt=8).
- The absolutely awesome [LaTeX Symbol List](http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf) by Scott Pakin

When creating your bibliography, there are several resources we find really useful. They provide you with data files with all the information you need.

- [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/)
- [MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/)
