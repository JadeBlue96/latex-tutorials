Installing LaTeX on a Mac is really easy. Here are three simple steps:


1. Visit the [TeX Users Group](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) page
2. Click on the `MacTeX.mpkg.zip` link to download the LaTeX package. The total file size is quite large, so go grab a book to read while it downloads.
3. Open the installer and follow the instructions. The default settings are just fine.

LaTeX, and all it's subsidiary packages have now been installed and you are ready to dive straight into creating your first document!

If you are worried about not knowing what you have just installed, here is a list of the main programs now at your disposal.
