This documentation aims to provide a grounding in the fundamental basics of LaTeX and the notions of typesetting mathematics. Some sections will contain extra tips and tricks, but nothing that is highly advanced. We donâ€™t want to scare people back to using Microsoft Word and Equation Editor nonetheless!

Do check out the [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/resources.html) page for other awesome places to learn LaTeX.
