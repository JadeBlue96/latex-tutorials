The best way to learn LaTeX is to have a go yourself. To make it easier for you to get started, we have broken down the essential building blocks of a typical document into even smaller bricks.

Each section, shown on the left, will guide you through setting up a basic LaTeX document and give you handy tips on making it super awesome.

The guides will have some interactive elements, so be prepared to dive straight in!

There is some hierarchy to the guides, as shown in the diagram below. This is purely optional, but we do suggest you work through them in order.<p>

As described in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">About</a> page. we cater for absolute beginners in LaTeX, so the end result will be just enough for you to get started.

For more in depth tutorials, visit the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation">Documentation</a> pages, or any of the excellent <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/resources">resources</a> elsewhere on the internet. This is particularly recommended if you already have some experience with LaTeX.

Once you have gotten to grips with the basics, you can practice typing mathematics, and more, on our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/practice">Practice</a> pages. The difficulty ranges from easy to hard. But for the hardcore LaTeX fans, some fiendish challenges lie ahead!
