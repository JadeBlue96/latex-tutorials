LaTeX Tutorials aims to reduce the steep learning curve imposed on those embarking on the journey that is: learning LaTeX. In truth, LaTeX is actually quite simple and one should not be intimidated by having to learn `code'. Commands in LaTeX are semantic and the syntax is consistent throughout. Be prepared to type lots of backslashes and familiar yourself with curly braces. Once you are happy with that, you are good to go!

Our target audience are absolute strangers to LaTeX. If you are an experienced veteran, for example `\renewcommand{}` is your best friend, then information we present here will seem trivial. We believe strongly that `practice makes perfect', hence have specially hand-crafted interactive guides in the basics of LaTeX.

We hope the information presented on this site is useful to you. If you feel we can improve certain areas, or have suggestions on how we can better the content, do feel free to contact us. Details are given below.

### Things you don't need to know, but might want to know.

#### Site history

- Version 1.0 &mdash; 10/2009 &mdash; XML database. Super hacky. Easter eggs galore, via Konami code.
- Version 2.0 &mdash; 05/2011 &mdash; WordPress backend. New front-end. Equations render with [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).
- Version 2.5 &mdash; 11/2011 &mdash; New front-end. Documentation section added. Equations render with via CodeCogs.
- Version 2.6 &mdash; 11/2012 &mdash; Server migration. All LaTeX commands lost their preceding backslash.
- Version 3.0 &mdash; 03/2013 &mdash; Integrated [QuickLaTeX](http://quicklatex.com) for static equation rendering.
- Version 3.1 &mdash; 04/2013 &mdash; Restyled equation practice pages. Added answers via _you know what_.
- Version 4.0 &mdash; 09/2013 &mdash; Redesigned entire site. New sections added. Old sections reorganised and updated. Jekyll backend.

#### Roadmap

We aim to expand and develop the content on the site to new levels. This means adding more practice equations to the database; revising the documentation; and developing new interactive elements for absolute beginners.
The current site is built on the following:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io)
- [QuickLaTeX](http://www.quicklatex.com/) for rendering static LaTeX
- [CodeCogs equation renderer](http://www.codecogs.com/) for live previews

All three of us studied at the [University of Warwick](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/) for an undergraduate degree in Mathematics. During that time, we got involved with the [Warwick Maths Society](http://warwickmaths.org) through various roles. Every year, one such role was to hold LaTeX classes for new undergraduates. We soon realised that even though they grasped the basics of LaTeX, many did not know how to take their new found knowledge to the next level.

Though this website was initially used in these classes as a teaching aid, we hope that it will encourage anyone learning LaTeX to continue practicing and discover the powerful capabilities LaTeX provides. 

### Contributors

Currently, there are no extra contributors, but we are always looking for a little help. If you would like to provide equations, extra tips and tricks, or corrections to the documentation, do get in touch!
No matter how small the contribution is, your name and a link (if provided) will be listed here.
