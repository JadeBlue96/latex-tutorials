We have collected together a wide range of mathematical equations for you to practice typing LaTeX. Throughout these pages, you will learn new symbols and commands which crop up over and over again. Feel free to experiment as well; if you find something cool and want to share, check out the sidenote at the bottom of this page!

On each page, you will be presented with an equation or formula. You simply have to enter LaTeX which will then be rendered, live. Once you have produced the required equation, you can move onto the next. Practice makes perfect!

Purposefully, we do not provide many tips on what symbols and commands you should use. We thoroughly encourage experimenting, or looking in online documents. Head over to the [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/resources) for some helpful links.

Simply choose your level to get started. All equations will appear in a random order. Come back to this page to select another category. 

Have fun!

#### Sidenote

We are always on the lookout for more equations to expand the current database. If you have any suggestions, or even want to help contribute, do send us an email. Or even better, fork this repo on [Github](https://github.com/gobbledygook88/latex-tutorials), add your own equations, and submit a pull request.
